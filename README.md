# Pair_Cross_Currency_Trade
Data Series Analysis of USDBRL and USDCNH

The data for the two series comes from the FRED database. After retrieving the data for the last 5 years, we merge it into one single dataframe and compute the log returns. Then, we plot the two series with scatter plot and draw the linear regression and write the equation to see if there is explanatory power into on currency or the other. Finally we compute the Beta of the two currencies to see the hedge ratio in case of a pair trade.
